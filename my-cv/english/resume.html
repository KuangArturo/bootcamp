            I excel at analyzing complex problems, designing solutions with structured diagrams, and balancing strategic planning with hands-on coding. Notably, I optimized a contact enhancement service handling over 20 company's contacts, improving efficiency and scalability. I emphasize rigorous testing to ensure software reliability and maintainability. Additionally, I thrive in Agile (Scrum) methodologies, collaborating effectively to deliver high-quality solutions.
